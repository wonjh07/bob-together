## ⚙️ Coding Rules

### Framework & Architecture
- Always use local MCP `context7` first
- Check official docs before assumptions
- Parse versions from `package.json`
- Prefer framework-native features
- Justify any custom implementation
- Read `ai_docs/INDEX.md` first and follow linked context docs before making changes

### Component Development
- Try to Reuse `utils/`, `libs/`, `hooks/`, `provider/` 
- Always consider reusable components
- Never use inline styles
- Make server components page using client components

### Code Quality
- If unsure, ask before changing code
- Write tests for new features
- Follow existing patterns in codebase
- When making changes, always base work on the current file state (users may edit before requesting)
- When an image is attached for a UI request, treat it as a component implementation request and reference `ai_docs/DESIGN_SCAN.md`
- For image-based UI work, list all visible text first and use that list to ensure no text is missed in implementation
- Always consider type-check and lint requirements while writing code

### Design Guardrails
- Own only the state this component must manage.
- Prefer derived state over stored state.
- Eliminate duplicated state across components.
- Group related props (e.g., `formState`, `handlers`) to reduce prop drilling.
- Use Provider only when shared state is truly required; prefer local state otherwise.
- Separate UI rendering concerns from data-loading concerns.

### Collaboration Workflow
- When a request is complex, analyze first, then provide a short plan before coding
- Before any code changes, show the proposed before/after snippets, explain why the change is justified, and get approval
- Apply changes only after approval, then proceed to the next step
- After massive code changes, run `npm run type-check` and `npm run lint`, then report results (skip for `*.md`-only changes)

### Context Management
- Update `ai_docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md` and relevant `ai_docs/*.md` files when making material changes
- If new AI docs are added, register them in `ai_docs/INDEX.md`
- Keep `ai_docs` concise, factual, and free of secrets/keys
- Use short sections with clear headings and bullet points

## 🐛 Debugging

### Approach
- Reproduce the issue before fixing
- Suspect dev server issues first
- Fix the cause, not the symptom
- Avoid speculative fixes
- Change one thing at a time
